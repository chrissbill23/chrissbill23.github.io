                        <p> I was born in Ivory Coast on September 23rd 1993, where I attended my first classes of elementary school and middle school. 
						</p>
						<p>
						When I reached the age of 14, I moved to Italy to live with my father, where I attended my High School and University classes. 
						I graduated in 2013 as a "Ragioniere" at the Technical-Economical Institute Riccati-Luzzatti in Treviso, and I obtained my bachelor in Computer Science in 2017 at the University of Padua.
                        </p>
						<p>Since I was 8, I am passionate about sciences and I grow up expanding my knowledge and skills on the technical part: I started with Biology and Chemestry with the intent of being a Doctor; 
						when I was in middle school and had my first class of Physics, I decided to focus on it as I was fascinated by the explanation of physical phenomena using maths. I wanted to specialize in physics and be a researcher;
						 in high school I decided to explore the science behind economy by enrolling in a specialized high school: a Technical-Economical Institute; Finally, for my university studies I decided to focus on Computer Science as it was a field I didn't explore before but have always been so curious about it. 
						I fell in love with it at the very first programming classes. The reason I fell in love with it, is the same reason I fell in love with Physics back in my middle school: Problem solving and be able to give life to your immagination.</p>
						<p>
						In 2020, after obtaining my bachelor and after working as a Software Developer, I decided to persue a MScT in Artificial Intelligence at École Polytechnique in Paris, in order to specialize in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I was successfully admited and I will graduate in 2021.
